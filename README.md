# Compiler

This is a class project when I was an undergraduate.
The language's grammar was provided to us as EBNF.
We were asked to implement it as an interpreter/compiler combo.

## Disclaimer

If you happen to be taking the same class, do not cheat off of this.
There's a good chance this code doesn't work very well at the moment anyways.
To quote directly from the man: "If you try to use this for homework, you can be certain that your instructor will find the matching code here and bust you. But your instructor may not be able to bust me because I might have graduated already. Ha-ha!"

## TODO
* Fix the bugs... does this thing even work?
* Use C++17 with smart pointers, enum classes, and variants
* Actually write the interpreter
* Write code generation for x86
